# Script to calculate accuracy rates and logit differences in parallel across multiple GPUs
#
# This script launches multiple instances of get_accuracy_rates_conversations.py,
# each handling a different seed and using a different GPU.
#
# Usage:
#   bash run_parallel_accuracy.sh
#
# The script will launch one process per seed (0-19 by default) and distribute
# them across available GPUs automatically.

# Get the script directory
SCRIPT_DIR="$( cd "$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )" && pwd )"

# Change to script directory for imports to work
cd "$SCRIPT_DIR"

# Number of seeds to process (should match NUM_SEEDS in experiment_config.py)

# Launch one process per GPU, each handling its assigned seeds sequentially
